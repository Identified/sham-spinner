###About
Mixins for scalable and customizable loading spinners that use inline SVG from your friends at Identified.com.

This means no images! They look great at any size, on any screen. Pass in $color, $size, and $speed variables for easy customization. Several commonly used styles are included: pinwheel, dots, circular, peacock, and the ubiquitous spokes.
